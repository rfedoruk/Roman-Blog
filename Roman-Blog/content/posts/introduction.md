Ok, so this is an explanation for what I want this blog to be. 

Over the past year or so I have noticed a bit of a disconnect. I am able to think pretty well, like in my brain I feel like I can articulate myself fairly well. 

When I open my mouth and try to say something however, all of that clear articulation is lost, I sound kind of stupid and am not able to really say things the way that I want to say them. 

Now, obviously I am not saying that I can't communicate at all, but in my opinion I am not able to communicate to the level that I would like to. 

This blog is an experiment to try and improve that. 

I've read from multiple people that the better you write the better you can think and communicate. So I would like to put that to the test. 

I don't have a fully formulated exactly what I want to write here, but I think I am going to basically try to write a few posts about why I think what I think, and then basically I want to write book reviews or summaries or something. 

Currently it's basically just me screaming into the void since this blog hasn't been indexed by google and no one even knows this domain exists, but hopefully I will change that and maybe a person or two will read this.
