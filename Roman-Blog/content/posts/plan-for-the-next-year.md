So, 2022. Big year I hope.

Obviously I would like to improve in every area, but I think there are a few things I would like to put extra focus into. Those would be: _fitness, programming, investing/crypto/business, and my spiritual life_. The biggest thing is just getting better habits and when problems do come up, to just course correct instead of just giving up completely. 

I am also going to be deleting Instagram and TikTok, at least for the first few months of the year. 

I also want to track my performance more, like somehow quantify what I'm doing everyday so that I can look back and see how I am progressing. 

For the first month or so I really want to focus on getting a good morning routine, and that is something I am going to work on today, figuring out what I am going to eat every morning, what steps things need to be done in, and what to do if some kind of unexpected thing happens that messes up the schedule. Also planning on using google calendar religiously. Every night I need to just have the next day planned, I don't want any days where I don't have anything planned. 

#### Fitness

Ok, so lets start with the plan for fitness. After seeing countless JPG Coaching videos I think low volume training to failure is the way to go. I also want to incorporate some bodyweight stuff as well. I am thinking M-T-Thu-F will be the split, Wednesdays I can either relax or simply do some cardio or something, those four days will be focused on strength training. I will also buy a scale and put it in my room so that I can weight myself every morning, and put that info into a spreadsheet. Gonna write out the workout schedule in a google sheets document or something. Also, gonna go hard for 8-10 weeks and then relax for a week or two, that is supposed to be a good thing to do. I found some good spreadsheets for tracking workouts and stuff, gonna figure out what split I'm going to do and put that information into the spread sheet.

Also need some sort of plan for regular cardio, not sure what to do with that yet. Maybe morning hikes once a week or something. 

#### Morning Routine

Ok, so the morning routine.

The tricky part here is that my days can be somewhat unpredictable and random. The two days that I can almost guarantee are consistent is going to be Tuesday and Thursday, since that is when I have classes and most likely will not have anything planned in the mornings. I think every day I would like to eat the same thing in the mornings, and the easiest to make would be overnight oats. So we are going to go with that. 

I also want to wake up at the same time every morning, and I want to wake up early. Again, slight problem is that there were many days last year when I would go to bed super late due to work, since there are a lot of overnight shifts in the movie business. 

I think the only viable solution is prioritize enough sleep, if I want to wake up at 5am every morning but I get home at 3 then it is not worth the consistency to sacrifice sleep like that. Probably best solution is to try to have the same morning routine no matter when I wake up. So, the rule is if I am able to, I will wake up at 5:15, if I can't then it is what it is. I think the cutoff will be if I am not asleep by 12:00, then just try to get at least 7 and a half hours of sleep, if before 12:00, then wake up 5:15. Obviously all of this is subject to change, but I want to try it consistently for a month at least before giving up on it.

So what is the morning routine? Here is what I'm thinking: 

* Wake up 5:15
* Immediately get feet on the ground, I'm tired of laying in bed for an hour, just get up. 
* Get on scale and record weight. 
* Drink some water, and get downstairs. 
* Read the bible for 15-20 minutes while eating the overnight oats that I should have prepared the preceding evening. 
* Come upstairs, sit down at desk and read non fiction book for 20-30 minutes, review what I have to get done that day, and get to work. 

So should take roughly an hour, if the day is a gym day then I immediately leave to go to the gym. 

#### Programming

 Programming, pretty cool stuff. 

So in the first two months I want to finish the code academy full stack course, just so that I have a good idea of how the whole stack works and am able to make a full stack app. 

Obviously in school I will probably doing some programming as well. I do have an interview for an internship in a couple of days, for a summer internship. I think it would be an interesting experience but I am unsure if just spending then summer building my own startup would be a more productive use of my time rather than summer internship. Not sure. 

I think the plan for programming is to at least spend an hour every day, weekends included. I really like doing it so it shouldn't be a problem or burden. I think after I finish the Code Academy course I will evaluate my skills and pick a direction. I think going in the direction of doing something with blockchain would be a good idea. 

#### Investing/Business/Crypto

Not too much to write here, continue investing in long term portfolio, allocate a certain amount of money to gamble in crypto and stocks, although a small percentage. Find some resources to learn more about investing. Build a long term oriented individual stock portfolio, read 10k's and whitepapers, just get more and more knowledge in different types of investing. 

Although I am focusing a lot on learning and education, I also want to make moves and take action. I don't think its necessary to set any concrete goals in this area, kind of hard to tell what is going to happen this year, but basically, if there is an opportunity and it makes sense, take it. 

#### Spiritual Life

Also not much to write here, try to make a habit of reading the bible every morning, find good sermons and books to read about belief and stuff. Just be better at this, more thoughtful.
