      <description>So, a sort of comprehensive recap of my 2021.
Overall it was a very interesting and formative year for me. There were plenty of ups and downs but I definitely learned a lot. One of the most interesting things that I have noticed is that there was some sort of mental click towards the latter part of the year. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to describe but it feels like I have become more calm, patient, emotionally stable, and interestingly enough I am also more confident.</description>

      <description>Ok, so this is an explanation for what I want this blog to be.
Over the past year or so I have noticed a bit of a disconnect. I am able to think pretty well, like in my brain I feel like I can articulate myself fairly well.
When I open my mouth and try to say something however, all of that clear articulation is lost, I sound kind of stupid and am not able to really say things the way that I want to say them.</description>
